## 🚨 CRITICAL GAPS (What Prevents 10/10)

### **1. Quick Wins Not Integrated in UI (BLOCKER)**
**Current:** Library exists but no UI to access it
**Impact:** Users don't see the instant value
**Fix:** Add "⚡ Quick Start" tab with copy buttons
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Priority:** CRITICAL - This is the highest-leverage feature

### **2. No Progressive Disclosure (Major Gap)**
**Current:** All 25 templates shown at once
**Reality:** Netflix doesn't show 10,000 movies at once
**Fix:**
- "Start Here" path for beginners (3 recommended templates)
- Smart filtering by skill level
- Hide advanced features until basics mastered
**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Priority:** HIGH

### **3. Missing Visual Examples (Major Gap)**
**Current:** Text descriptions only
**Reality:** "Show, don't tell" - users need to SEE what prompts create
**Fix:**
- Image gallery showing results from each template
- Before/after comparisons for editing workflow
- Visual proof that templates work
**Effort:** 8-10 hours (requires generating actual images)
**Priority:** HIGH

### **4. No Learning Path/Curriculum (Medium Gap)**
**Current:** Random exploration
**Reality:** Duolingo has structured Day 1 → Day 7 paths
**Fix:**
- "Day 1: Your First 3 Prompts" tutorial
- "Day 3: Master Photography Basics" lesson
- "Day 7: Advanced Multi-Image Workflows" challenge
**Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Priority:** MEDIUM

### **5. No Social Proof (Medium Gap)**
**Current:** "Here are templates"
**Reality:** "10,000+ users created stunning images with this"
**Fix:**
- Usage statistics ("Most popular template")
- Success stories ("Sarah created her product catalog in 30 minutes")
- Community examples
**Effort:** 4-6 hours (+ backend for tracking)
**Priority:** MEDIUM

### **6. Limited Examples (Minor Gap)**
**Current:** 5 templates have examples
**Reality:** Should be 15-20 examples
**Fix:** Add examples to remaining high-value templates
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Priority:** LOW (quality > quantity)
